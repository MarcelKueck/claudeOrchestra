# ClaudeOrchestra: Personal Multi-Agent Development Framework

## Overview

ClaudeOrchestra is a personal development tool that orchestrates multiple specialized Claude 3.7 agents to collaborate on software projects. It transforms a single AI assistant into a coordinated team of specialists that handle different aspects of the development process.

## Core Concept

Rather than interacting with a single general-purpose Claude instance, ClaudeOrchestra lets you interact with specialized "agents" - each with optimized prompts for specific roles in the software development lifecycle:

- Product Manager Agent: Requirements gathering and feature prioritization
- System Architect Agent: Technical design and technology selection
- Developer Agent: Implementation and coding
- QA Agent: Testing and quality assurance
- Technical Writer Agent: Documentation generation

The system maintains context between agent interactions and preserves knowledge across the project lifecycle.

## Key Features

1. **Specialized Agent Templates**: Optimized prompts for each development role
2. **Context Management**: Efficient knowledge transfer between agents
3. **Project Organization**: Structured storage of project artifacts
4. **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interaction for daily use
5. **Basic Web UI**: Visual interface for project management
6. **Claude Code Integration**: Seamless connection to Claude's coding capabilities

## Architecture

ClaudeOrchestra is implemented as a lightweight Python application with these components:

1. **Agent Framework**: Base classes and specialized agents
2. **Knowledge Store**: File-based project and context storage
3. **CLI Interface**: Command-line interaction for agent conversations
4. **Web Interface**: Simple Flask-based dashboard
5. **Claude API Client**: Integration with Claude 3.7
6. **Claude Code Integration**: Wrapper for Claude Code CLI

## Workflow Example

Here's how a typical workflow operates:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   ```bash
   $ co init my-project "A task management web app"
   ```

2. **Requirements Gathering** (Product Manager Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent pm my-project "Define core user stories"
   ```

3. **Architecture Design** (Architect Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent architect my-project "Design system architecture"
   ```

4. **Implementation** (Developer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent developer my-project "Implement user authentication"
   ```

5. **Test Planning** (QA Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent qa my-project "Create test plan for authentication"
   ```

6. **Documentation** (Technical Writer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent writer my-project "Document the API"
   ```

## Personal Development Benefits

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Access to different perspectives and specialized knowledge
2. **Coherent Projects**: Maintain consistency across complex projects
3. **Knowledge Management**: Build persistent project knowledge over time
4. **Workflow Automation**: Reduce repetitive context setting
5. **Learning**: Observe how different specialists approach problems

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Claude API key
- Claude Code CLI (optional but recommended)
- GitHub account (optional)
