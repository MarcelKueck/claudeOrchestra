# ClaudeOrchestra: Personal Multi-Agent Development Framework

## Overview

ClaudeOrchestra is a personal development tool that orchestrates multiple specialized Claude 3.7 agents to collaborate on software projects. It transforms a single AI assistant into a coordinated team of specialists that handle different aspects of the development process.

## Core Concept

Rather than interacting with a single general-purpose Claude instance, ClaudeOrchestra lets you interact with specialized "agents" - each with optimized prompts for specific roles in the software development lifecycle:

### Strategic Agents
- **Product Manager Agent**: Requirements gathering and feature prioritization
- **System Architect Agent**: Technical design and technology selection
- **Project Manager Agent**: Task breakdown and coordination

### Development Agents
- **Frontend Developer Agent**: UI/UX implementation
- **Backend Developer Agent**: API and service implementation
- **Database Engineer Agent**: Schema design and data management
- **DevOps Engineer Agent**: Deployment and infrastructure

### Quality Agents
- **QA Agent**: Testing and quality assurance
- **Security Engineer Agent**: Security assessment and implementation
- **Technical Writer Agent**: Documentation generation

The system maintains context between agent interactions and preserves knowledge across the project lifecycle.

## Key Features

1. **Specialized Agent Templates**: Optimized prompts for each development role
2. **Context Management**: Efficient knowledge transfer between agents
3. **Project Organization**: Structured storage of project artifacts
4. **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interaction for daily use
5. **Basic Web UI**: Visual interface for project management
6. **Claude Code Integration**: Seamless connection to Claude's coding capabilities

## Architecture

ClaudeOrchestra is implemented as a lightweight Python application with these components:

1. **Agent Framework**: Base classes and specialized agents
2. **Knowledge Store**: File-based project and context storage
3. **CLI Interface**: Command-line interaction for agent conversations
4. **Web Interface**: Simple Flask-based dashboard
5. **Claude API Client**: Integration with Claude 3.7
6. **Claude Code Integration**: Wrapper for Claude Code CLI

## Workflow Example

Here's how a typical workflow operates:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   ```bash
   $ co init my-project "A task management web app"
   ```

2. **Requirements Gathering** (Product Manager Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent pm my-project "Define core user stories"
   ```

3. **Architecture Design** (Architect Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent architect my-project "Design system architecture"
   ```

4. **Database Design** (Database Engineer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent db my-project "Design database schema"
   ```

5. **API Development** (Backend Developer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent backend my-project "Implement user authentication API"
   ```

6. **Frontend Implementation** (Frontend Developer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent frontend my-project "Create login interface"
   ```

7. **Security Review** (Security Engineer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent security my-project "Review authentication implementation"
   ```

8. **Deployment Configuration** (DevOps Engineer Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent devops my-project "Create deployment pipeline"
   ```

9. **Test Planning** (QA Agent):
   ```bash
   $ co agent qa my-project "Create test plan for authentication"
   ```

10. **Documentation** (Technical Writer Agent):
    ```bash
    $ co agent writer my-project "Document the API"
    ```

## Scaling for Project Complexity

ClaudeOrchestra is designed to scale with your project needs:

1. **Personal Projects**: For small personal projects, you might only use a few agents (PM, Developer, QA)

2. **Professional Applications**: For more complex applications, add specialized agents (Frontend, Backend, Database)

3. **Enterprise Solutions**: For enterprise-grade projects, utilize the full suite of specialized agents with robust knowledge management

## Benefits

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Access to different perspectives and specialized knowledge
2. **Coherent Projects**: Maintain consistency across complex projects
3. **Knowledge Management**: Build persistent project knowledge over time
4. **Workflow Automation**: Reduce repetitive context setting
5. **Learning**: Observe how different specialists approach problems

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Claude API key
- Claude Code CLI (optional but recommended)
- GitHub account (optional)
- Ubuntu/Linux environment
