## How to Use These Templates

1. Replace the placeholder variables (in {curly_braces}) with actual project information
2. Use the templates as system prompts when initializing each agent
3. Maintain consistency in terminology and formatting across agents
4. Adapt the templates as needed for your specific projects
5. For smaller projects, you may choose to use only a subset of agents
6. For complex projects, use all specialized agents with detailed context
